### 🚀 The 2.0 Rebuild
Legends Tracker is a comprehensive architectural overhaul of the original QuestTracker project. This fork focuses on data optimization, memory efficiency, and up-to-date patch support.

#### **Key Improvements**
* **Optimized Data:** Every quest entry is being manually refactored to remove vertical bloat and flatten ID arrays.
* **Multi-File Architecture:** Moving toward a split JSON system (e.g., `MSQ_Spine.json`) to improve plugin load times.
* **Modern Versioning:** Using a `v[Rebuild].[GamePatch].[Expansion].[Iteration]` system to ensure you always know exactly what content is supported.
